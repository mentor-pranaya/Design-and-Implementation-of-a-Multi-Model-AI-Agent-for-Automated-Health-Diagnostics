Phase-1 is considered COMPLETE when:

1. The system accepts a blood report (JSON/CSV, PDF optional).
2. All key parameters are extracted with correct numeric values and units.
3. Values are validated and standardized.
4. Each parameter is classified as Low / Normal / High using medical reference ranges.
5. The pipeline runs end-to-end without a database or API.
6. Results are verified against manual ground truth for multiple reports.
