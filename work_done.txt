 Yesterday and today, I focused on building and implementing the core code for the project. The main logic and functionalities have been developed and integrated successfully. 
Most of the coding work is now complete, and the project structure is nearly finalized. Further work will involve minor refinements, testing, and validation to ensure smooth executive.
