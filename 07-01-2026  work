Today I organized my Health AI project and worked on proper file and folder structuring.
I successfully pushed my Model-1 automated health diagnostics code to my GitHub branch.
I resolved Git errors related to branches, merges, and remote repositories.
I learned how to delete and reorganize project files correctly using Git and VS Code.
Finally, I ensured the project is clean, structured, and ready for further development or review.
